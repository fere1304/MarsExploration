# Description

You use the rover to see if the area it is traversing can be colonized.
If you have enough minerals and water the the output would be **Colonizable**, if not, the output would be **Error**.
If the time expired and the necessary resources were not found, the output would be **Timeout**.

# Features

> - **Generate a map** with 4 elements: minerals, pockets of water, mountains and pits.
> - The rover goes through the map to analyze if there are enough resources for the area to be colonized.
> - The rover can **avoid revisiting areas that are already explored**.
> - The rover decide the **next step** completely **randomly**.
> - After the information is gathered, an outcome is reached: **Colonizble** when the right conditions for colonization are met, **TimeOut** when the current step of the rover reached the timeout amount and **Error** when the rover almost explored the whole chart and no right condition is found.
